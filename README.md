# 🚦 Task 04: Traffic Accident Analysis

As part of my internship with **SkillCraft Technologies**, this project analyzes traffic accident data from the **US Accidents Dataset (2016–2021)** to uncover patterns based on **time, location, and weather conditions**. The project also includes geospatial visualizations to help identify accident hotspots.

## 📊 Key Findings

- ⏰ **Rush Hour Peaks**: Accidents spike around **8 AM** and **5–6 PM**, corresponding to work commute times.
- 📅 **Weekday Dominance**: Most accidents occur on **weekdays**, especially from **Tuesday to Friday**.
- 📆 **End-of-Year Surge**: Accident rates increase during the final months of the year, with **December** being the highest.
- 🌧️ **Weather Impact**: **Rain, fog, and cloudy conditions** are frequently linked to higher accident counts.
- 🧭 **Geographic Clusters**: Hotspots are concentrated in **urban areas and near major highways**.
- ⚠️ **Severity Distribution**: Most accidents are **moderately severe (Level 2)**, with fewer cases at severity level 4.
